This section will go through how to simulate Identity and Access Management for an Assistant. The steps consist of: 

1. Create a variable assigned to an expression of a dictionary within the assistant platfrom and include the necessary users and their appropriate metadata within the dictionary.
2. Modify the "Greet Customer" action within the assistant

### Variable Creation
1. Within the "Actions" section of the Assistant navigate to the "Created by you" variables and select "New Variable+"
2. Create a variable name and set variable type to "Any"
3. Update the "initial value":
    - Toggle the "Use Expression" to on
    - Create dictionary value:
    
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
ex)
```json
[
    {
        "name":"martha",
        "password":"MARTHA",
        "access":"Admin",
        "role":"Manager"
    },
    {
        "name":"robert",
        "password":"ROBERT",
        "access":"Employee",
        "role":"Employee"
    }
]
```
</div>
4. Click "Save"

### Modify "Greet Customer" Action
- Within the "Actions" section of the Assistant, navigate to the "Greet Customer" action

#### **Authenticate User**
1. Check valid user by setting a new boolean variable to an expression value of:

    ``` !(( [users variable from "Variable Creation" step above]).filter("user", "user.name ==  [current_user value]")).isEmpty()) ```

    Example)
    
    ![Valid User Example](../../images/valid_user_example.png)


2. Ensure valid password by creating conditional statement with expression value of :

    ``` [current_password value] == (users.filter("user", "user.name == [current_user value]"))[0].password  ```

    Example)

   ![Valid Password Example](../../images/valid_pass_example.png)

#### **Change User's Password**
1. Set a new password for the current user with an expression like:
    ```((( ${users}.filter(\"user\", \"user.name ==  ${current_user} \"))[0]).password) = ${new_pass}```
2. Validate changed password with:
    ```((( ${users}.filter(\"user\", \"user.name ==  ${current_user} \"))[0]).password) ```
