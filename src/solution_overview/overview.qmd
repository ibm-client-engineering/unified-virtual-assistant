The objective of this solution is to demonstrate a chatbot which has the ability to orchestrate conversations to the
appropriate channels and/or 3rd-party applications while leveraging generative AI technologies. To build a unified virtual assistant and achieve the desired outcomes for success, this solution will leverage watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span> Orchestrate to deliver six core capabilities: <br>

* **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**
    * Secure Login: Authenticates users based on roles.
    * Access Control: Restricts actions to authorized data and features.
    * Role-Based Privileges:
        * Admins: Access advanced features like global password changes.
        * Users: Limited to basic functions, ensuring simplicity and security.

* **Generative AI-Driven Routing:** Classifies user prompts into categories, improving conversation routing accuracy and streamlining interactions.
* **RAG Document Search:** Ensures accurate, reliable search results by combining a Data Repository, Vector Database, and Large Language Model, with up-to-date information and source links.
* **Third-Party Integrations:** Connects the chatbot to platforms like ServiceNow to automate workflows, reduce silos, and enable customized, efficient operations.
* **Governance:** Implements IBM® watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span>.governance™ to manage AI risks, ensure compliance, monitor models, and document processes, fostering transparency and accountability.
* **Subordinate Bot Mediation:** Enables seamless collaboration with existing chatbots by delegating domain-specific requests while providing unified responses through the parent bot.
