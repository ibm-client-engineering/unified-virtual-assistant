# Overview

The objective of this solution is to demonstrate a chatbot which has the ability to orchestrate conversations to the
appropriate channels and/or 3rd-party applications while leveraging generative AI technologies. This unified agent solution revolves around six key capabilities:

# Solution Components
## **Web-Chat Interface**
* Leveraging IBM Cloud Object Storage to host a static website for the chatbot.
    * Configuration Steps [here](/Implementation/imp-UI.html)

## **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
IAM can be carried out in one of two methods:  

* Security Verify SSO  
* Simulation

### **IBM Security Verify SSO**
Leverage the IBM Security Verify API to carry differnt actions like authenticating user logins and resetting passwords within the Assistant builder UI.

[Implementation Guide Here](/Implementation/imp-verify-assis.html)

### **Simulation**
Simulating user login within watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span> Orchestrate Assistant Builder can be achieved by storing simulated individuals in a data structure. This data structure, typically a list or map, can store information about each simulated user, such as their name, access level, and other relevant details. By initializing this data structure with a set of simulated users, you can create a realistic login scenario where the system checks user credentials and grants or denies access accordingly.

Storing simulated individuals in a data structure within watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span> Orchestrate Assistant Builder allows you to test the login functionality and ensure that the system behaves as expected. This can help identify potential issues early in the development process, saving time and resources. Additionally, you can customize the simulated users' data to represent different user types, enabling you to test the system's access control mechanisms and ensure that users are only granted access to the appropriate actions and data.

By using simulated users in this manner, you can thoroughly test the user login functionality and ensure that the unified agent with generative AI capabilities is secure, reliable, and user-friendly.

## **Conversational Engine**
The conversational engine was built using watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span> Orchestrate Assistant Builder where generative AI-driven routing was configured to direct users to the most appropriate workflows and data based on their access permissions.

## **Integrations**

### **RAG Document Search**
RAG Document Search can be carried out in one of two methods:

#### 1. **watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span> Discovery:**
This pattern consists of creating an integration with watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span> Discovery. watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span> Discovery leverage a vectorDB to store data corpus's embeddings to enable RAG. <br>
**Required Integrations:**

* watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span> Discovery
* watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span>.ai

[Implementation Guide Here](/Implementation/watsonx-dis.html)

#### 2. **watson Discovery:**
This pattern consists of creating two integrations with watson Discovery and watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span>.ai. Watson Discovery is used to store and carry out searches on data collections.

**Required Integrations:**

* watson Discovery
* watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span>.ai

[Implementation Guide Here](/Implementation/watson-dis.html)

### **Governance**
Governance is exemplified in two key ways:

* **watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span>.gov:** IBM's enterprise governance platform for monitoring key metrics associated with LLMs
* **RAG Source Attribution Links**

#### watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span>.gov
![](./images/gov_arch.png)

In summary, the implementation of IBM® watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span>.governance™ provides a comprehensive and seamless solution for the development, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring of AI models, ensuring compliance, transparency, and optimal performance throughout the AI lifecycle.

**Required Integrations:** 

* watson<span style="color:#2c62f5;">x</span>.gov

[Implementation Guide Here](/Implementation/watsonx-gov.html)

#### RAG Source Links
For every user query that involves RAG Document Search, a source link will be provided with each response to ensure transparency by clearly indicating the data corpus from which the answer was derived.
